# robots.txt
#
# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts
# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!
# and Google. By telling these "robots" where not to go on your site,
# you save bandwidth and server resources.
#
# This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host:
# Used:    http://example.com/robots.txt
# Ignored: http://example.com/site/robots.txt
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html
#
# For syntax checking, see:
# http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/robots/check.html

# File identity - 
# So that the contents of this file are copied only once to DocumentRoot/robots.txt  at
# installation time the file must contain a unique string.  
# The copy_robots_text.pl program looks for a line with a string of the form "hhh ddd vvv ooo"
# where hhh is '#'
#       ddd is 'Drupal'
#       vvv is 'version'
#       ooo is some other chars to make it unique. For instance, using the version and installation directory (see 3 lines down).
# If copy_robots_text.pl finds that string in DocumentRoot/robots.txt it assumes that the data is already there and does not copy again.
# DO NOT REMOVE THE NEXT LINE - it prevents copying to DocumentRoot more than once.
# Drupal version 6.15 /rbell/
